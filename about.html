            <h4> <b>Who is Xolisa?</b></h4>
        </b>
        <p>
            Xolisa is a detail-oriented work in progress! By day, I am constantly at work trying to find my feet in tech. But I'm also someone who's constantly striving to learn and grow. My strengths definitely lie in project management , adaptability and curiousity – these allow me to work independently and in grows as well as constantly find ways to the get the job done in a timely manner. However, I'm still working on discipline , procrastination and inquisitiveness  –  which sometimes leads to want to take on too many projects at once which then kinda makes me run around like a chicken with my head off. But hey, that's part of the journey, right?

       <h4> <b>Why frontend develpment?</b></h4>
        <p>
            I was drawn to front-end development because it feels like a complex art class to me.  Just like a painter, I get to use color theory, composition, and even a bit of user psychology to create engaging user interfaces.  But instead of a canvas, my code becomes the brush that brings the design to life.  The process of transforming a static design into a fully functional and interactive experience is incredibly rewarding.  It allows me to combine my passion for design with my technical skills, making front-end development the perfect blend of creativity and functionality for me.

    <div class="challenge">
        <h4><b>Biggest chanllenge you found with coding/learning to code?</b></h4>
        <p>
            As a naturally curious learner, I sometimes find myself juggling multiple coding projects at once. While this keeps things exciting and allows me to explore different areas of front-end development, it can also lead to a hefty workload. To tackle this challenge, I've developed better project management skills, prioritizing tasks and setting realistic deadlines. It's a constant learning process, but it helps me channel my curiosity into focused progress.

        <h4><b>What do you like to do in your free time?</b></h4>
        <p>
            In my free time, I'm all about unwinding and letting my imagination wander. There's nothing quite like soaking up the sun with a good book and some music – it's the perfect escape from the daily grind. Recently, I've discovered a new guilty pleasure: playing The Sims! It allows me to tap into my creative side by designing dream homes and crafting unique stories for my virtual characters. It's a fun way to unwind and unleash my creativity in a different way.
